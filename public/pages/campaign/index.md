# Campaign


When my mum and dad worked out how much it would cost to get a new home ready
for me, they realised they couldn't do it alone. They didn't like to ask for
help, but friends insisted they should. So, thinking maybe we would raise
one or two thousand pounds, my dad set up
[a GoFundMe page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-home-for-mo).

It is impossible to put into words how astonished and grateful we all were as
the donations poured in, in the end raising over &pound;100,000. Our hearts are
full of thankfulness for the generosity of so many people, those who know us,
and those who heard of us through the radio, news and social media.
