      <description>I live with my family in Chester, England. As I&amp;rsquo;ve grown older, and needed more and more help, our previous house became too small for me. Soon I will have two carers with me, round the clock. I needed more space for my supplies, my equipment and my carers. And it&amp;rsquo;s important to keep my family together. So my mum and dad have been working hard to find us a new home.</description>

      <description>When my mum and dad worked out how much it would cost to get a new home ready for me, they realised they couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it alone. They didn&amp;rsquo;t like to ask for help, but friends insisted they should. So, thinking maybe we would raise one or two thousand pounds, my dad set up a GoFundMe page.

      <description>James on the left, Morgan on the right: incubator transport
Q: What were you looking for in the new home?
A: As with any house purchase, some things were non-negotiable and others were nice-to-have! The non-negotiables:
Privacy*. This essentially meant a separate &amp;ldquo;wing&amp;rdquo; or annex for Mo, where sound doesn&amp;rsquo;t travel too much into the main house. Morgan can be quite noisy, at any time of the day! This also means that he can enjoy things like music therapy without worrying about the impact on anyone else.</description>
