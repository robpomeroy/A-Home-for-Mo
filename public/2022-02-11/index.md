The last couple of months have been stressful on multiple fronts, but this week
we had the news we've been waiting for. Contracts exchanged - and the new house
becomes ours NEXT MONDAY! Valentine's Day! (We're in love.
:(fas fa-grin-hearts):)

Over the next five weeks, there's a lot of work to coordinate - electrical,
plastering, hoist installation, wheelchair-accessible doors, some decorating and
so on. This is all to make the property ready for us to move into at the end of
March. That will take us to the "interim" position for Morgan, with the lounge
becoming his bedroom.

We've had an initial site visit with our architect. He will be working with us
to design the annex for Morgan (conversion of double garage, plus new room).
Then we'll go through the planning and build process, which we estimate could
take 12 months until completion. So there's a fair bit of road yet to travel,
but this week marks a momentous milestone.

Thank you for all your care and support!

Love, Rob, Sharon, Mo &amp; James
