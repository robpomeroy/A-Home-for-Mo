Sharon and I had a great (nerve-wracking) opportunity to speak live on
[UCB2](https://www.ucb.co.uk/ucb2) this morning about special needs parenting
and the ongoing campaign to raise money towards a home for Morgan.

This interview focuses a *lot* on our faith and how it affects our story. If
that's not your jam, we understand, no problem. :(fa fa-heart):

Thank you UCB and to all those who made this happen! We have some further
possible opportunities to tell our story in the media - we'll let you know if
they come to fruition.

Find out more about Ruth O'Reilly-Smith's show *This is my story*, on
[UCB's website](https://www.ucb.co.uk/ruth).
