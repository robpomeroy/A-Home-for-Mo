**Q: What do you most need in a home?**

A: Sufficient ground floor space for Mo (bedroom, bathroom, lounge and utility
room). Privacy (when required) for the rest of the family. In practice this
means annex-style accommodation.

**Q: Can't you extend your existing house?**

A: We've looked closely at this and even gone as far as having plans drawn up,
a few years ago. We've reluctantly concluded that although we love our home,
there's is no way to make it work by extending.

**Q: Chester seems expensive. Can't you move somewhere cheaper?**

A: We have considered this, but there are many things anchoring us to Chester,
from the boys' school to the specialist medical professionals old in all aspects
of Mo's care.
