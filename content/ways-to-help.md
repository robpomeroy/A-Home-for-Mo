* Run a fundraising even in your community - a bake sale, a board games evening,
  a talent show, shave your hair or beard, a sponsored car wash - anything!
  (Please observe COVID-safe precautions.)
* Run a social media campaign - it is very hard to sustain momentum,
  singlehandedly; continually raising the profile of the campain is totally
  invaluable.
* Ask your business, charity, club or church if they would be willing to
  support this cause.
