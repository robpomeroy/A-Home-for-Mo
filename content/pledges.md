In addition to the amounts donated, some fabulous people have offered their
suport in other ways. These pledges are incredible and may offer some
inspiration for other ways to help with this campaign.

* **Interest-free loan**: to our utter astonishment some very kind friends have
  offered, in place of bridging finance, an interest-free loan. This could
  enable us to complete the purchase of the new home before we complete the
  sale of our current home - *without* recourse to expensive finance.
* **Fundraising show**: our good friend
  <a href="https://chestertowncriers.com/profile-david-mitchell/" target="_blank">David Mitchell</a>,
  renowned after-dinner speaker and Chester's own Town Crier, has amazingly
  offered to put on a show, with all profits being donated to this cause. The
  show is in the process of being arranged; details to follow. Oh, David asked
  me to point out his dazzling good looks.
* **Estate agency**: Gareth Friend, of local estate agents [Carmen Friend](https://www.carmanfriend.com/)
  has very kindly offered his services free of charge.
