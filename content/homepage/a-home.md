I live with my family in a lovely home in Chester, England. As I've grown older,
and needed more and more help, the house has become too small for me. Soon I
will need two-to-one care, 24 hours a day. We need more space for my supplies,
my equipment and my carers. And we need to keep the family together.

#### Why a new home?

It's important for me to be near my parents and especially my brother (what can
I say - he needs me!). They know me best and what I need. So I need my family
around me. But I also need my carers.

Home is the best place for me where I have everything I need. It's like having a
hospital in my home. And for a hospital, you need a **lot** of space. Space for
my two wheelchairs {{<icon class="fa fa-wheelchair">}}
{{<icon class="fa fa-wheelchair-alt">}}, all my supplies, my special bed and
{{<icon class="fa fa-bed">}} bath {{<icon class="fa fa-bath">}}, my hoists -
everything.

At the same time, it can be difficult for the rest of my family, when there are
carers in the home all day and all night. It makes it hard to have a private
family life. Sometimes I'm noisy at night and wake everyone up. My mum is
basically a {{<icon class="fa fa-superpowers">}} superhero. But even superheroes
need to sleep.
