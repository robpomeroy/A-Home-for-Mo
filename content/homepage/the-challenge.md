> Being disabled is expensive. Being profoundly disabled is *really* expensive.
  (Remember my &pound;11,000 bath?)

I have a big problem&nbsp;{{<icon class="fa fa-bug">}}. Any house I move to
needs to be adapted for me. That can include:

* Widening doorways for my
  wheelchair&nbsp;{{<icon class="fa fa-wheelchair-alt">}}
* Adding ceiling track hoists
* Creating ramped and level access
* Installing my specialised bath&nbsp;{{<icon class="fa fa-bath">}}

Mum and Dad can't adapt a house while I'm living there. They can't afford to
buy another house without selling the existing one. There aren't many places
suitable for me to move to while work is underway and my brother really doesn't
like to be away from me (seriously - he suffers from anxiety and is on the 
autistic spectrum). Staying together is always the best option.

On top of that, moving house once is going to be hard enough (especially since
James struggles with change), but moving twice - once into temporary
accommodation and again into the finished house - is almost unthinkable. The
best option by far is to make the new house ready while I'm still living in
the old house with my family. Then we move just once.

How this can happen is my Great Big Problem and it's the reason this website
exists.

#### What do I need?

I need a home:

* Where my family can stay together
* **In Chester**, because it needs to be near:
  * [my school](https://www.deebanksschool.co.uk/)&nbsp;{{<icon class="fa fa-graduation-cap">}} -
    my body makes it difficult to go long distances - sometimes I need a
    sedative to be able to travel - serious stuff
  * My hospital
  * In particular, my GP & pharmacy; they know me well and are good at handling
    all my many (20+!) prescriptions
* With a bedroom and bathroom downstairs for me
* With space for my carers
* With space for my all supplies and equipment
* With space for my own washing machine (I won't explain why!)
* Where my family can have privacy

I don't know how many houses meet *all* these requirements. They seem to cost at
least &pound;500,000 (a *lot* more than my current home). And adaptations for me
and James could cost &pound;100,000 or even more. This means spending
~&pound;300,000 more than my current house is worth. Somehow I need to raise
that much.
