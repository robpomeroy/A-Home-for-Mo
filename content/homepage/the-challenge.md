> Being disabled is expensive. Being profoundly disabled is *really* expensive.
  (Remember my £11,000 bath?)

We have a big problem&nbsp;{{<icon class="fa fa-bug">}}. Any house I move to
needs to be adapted for me. That can include:

* Widening doorways for my
  wheelchair&nbsp;{{<icon class="fa fa-wheelchair-alt">}}
* Adding ceiling track hoists
* Creating ramped and level access
* Installing my specialised bath&nbsp;{{<icon class="fa fa-bath">}}

Mum and Dad can't adapt a house while I'm living there. They can't afford to
buy another house without selling the existing house. There aren't many places
suitable for me to move to while work is underway and my brother really doesn't
like to be away from me. Staying together is always the best option.

On top of that, moving house once is going to be hard enough (especially since
James struggles with change), but moving twice - once into temporary
accommodation and again into the finished house - is almost unthinkable. The
best option by far is to make the new house ready while we're still living in
the old house. Then we move just once.

How we do this is our Great Big Problem and it's the reason this website exists.

#### What do I need?

I need a home:

* Where my family can stay together
* In Chester (it needs to be near
  [my school](https://www.deebanksschool.co.uk/)&nbsp;{{<icon class="fa fa-graduation-cap">}};
  my body makes it difficult to go long distances - sometimes I need sedation,
  to be able to travel)
* Close to my GP, pharmacy and hospital - especially the GP & pharmacy; they
  know me well and are good at handling all my many (20+!) prescriptions
* With a bedroom and bathroom downstairs for me
* With space for my carers
* With space for my all supplies and equipment
* Ideally, with space for my own washing machine (I won't explain why!)
* Where my family can have privacy

Houses meeting all these requirements tend to be at least £500,000. In addition,
adaptations could cost another £100,000 or more. This means spending ~ £300,000
more than my current house is worth. Somehow we need to raise that much.
