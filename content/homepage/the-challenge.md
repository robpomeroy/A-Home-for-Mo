> Being disabled is expensive. Being profoundly disabled is *really* expensive.

We have a big problem {{<icon class="fa fa-bug">}}. Any house I move to needs to
be adapted for me. That can include:

* Widening doorways for my wheelchair {{<icon class="fa fa-wheelchair-alt">}}
* Adding ceiling track hoists
* Creating ramped and level access
* Installing my specialised bath {{<icon class="fa fa-bath">}}

Mum and Dad can't adapt a house while I'm living there. They can't afford to
buy another house without selling the existing house. There aren't many places
suitable for me to move to while work is underway and my brother really doesn't
like to be away from me. Staying together is always the best option.

On top of that, moving house once is going to be hard enough (especially since
James struggles with change), but moving twice - once into temporary
accommodation and again into the finished house - is almost unthinkable. The
best option by far is to make the new house ready while we're still living in
the old house. Then we move just once.

How we do this is our Great Big Problem and it's the reason this website exists.

#### What do I need?

I need a home:

* In Chester (it needs to be near
  [my school](https://www.deebanksschool.co.uk/)
  {{<icon class="fa fa-graduation-cap">}}; my body makes it difficult to
  go long distances - sometimes I need sedation, to be able to travel
* With a bedroom and bathroom downstairs for me
* With space for my carers
* With space for my all supplies and equipment
* Ideally, with space for my own washing machine (I won't explain why!)

[ insert something about GP, pharmacy and medicines ]

Houses meeting all these requirements tend to be at least £450,000 (for a house
that needs work). In addition, adaptations could cost another £50,000 or more.
This means spending £200,000-300,000 more than my current house is worth. So
we need to raise or borrow at least that much.

#### How might this be possible?

We're scratching our heads! Here are some options:

##### Option 1: rent temporary accommodation

*Additional cost ~ £12,000. Practicality: impossible?*

We don't like this option because of the huge disruption of moving twice. Costs
include:

* Paying a removal company twice
* Rental fees for somewhere suitable in Chester
* Storage costs for some of our belongings

This probably would not work because we could not install ceiling track hoists
in a rental property. There *may* be a suitable property with hoists already
installed though.

[ not many places are wheelchair accessible ]

##### Option 2: bridging finance

*Additional cost ~ £15,0000. Practicality: uncertain*

Raising a bridging loan could enable us to buy a new house and spend two or
three months undertaking the adaptations before moving in. This would depend on:

* Finding a buyer for our house who was willing to wait this long before moving
  in - leaving three months between exchange of contracts and completion.
* Finding a lender willing to provide this sort of finance on these terms.

##### Audacious option 3: fund raise - all of it

*Total cost ~ £500,0000. Practicality: la la land?*

Could we raise the full cost of buying a house and adapting it? My dad tells me
that some businesses call this a "moon shot" {{<icon class="fa fa-moon">}} or a
"big hairy audacious goal". It's a lot of money.
