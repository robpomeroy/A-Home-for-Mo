***UPDATE:*** *bridging finance may longer be necessary - see the
[pledges](pledges) page!*

We're all scratching our heads how to do this! Bridging finance (borrowing the
cost of the new house) might be one way to allow my parents to buy the new house
*before* the sale completed on the currrent house. This would mean my
adaptations could be completed before I move in.

Bridging finance is not cheap. Neither are the many things I will need done to
do to the new house (many of which were done for my current home). Disabled
Facilities Grant are normally an option, but it's only possible to apply for a
grant once you have a house to move into. The grant process moves too slowly
compared to the house moving process, so it's unlikely the timescales will line
up. We will however still pursue this option, in the hope it will cover some of
the costs.

You'll remember that but for my addtitional needs, my family would not be
moving. Here is an estimate of some possible costs in finding me a suitable new
home:

| Item | Estimated cost |
| :- | -: |
| Adaptations for James | &pound;5,000 |
| Wheelchair accessible paths | &pound;7,500 |
| Doorway widening | &pound;7,500 |
| Wheelchair accessible garden room | &pound;7,500 |
| Facilitate parking for care staff | &pound;7,500 |
| Ramped access | &pound;10,000 |
| Wet room | &pound;15,000 |
| Interest on bridging loan (3 months) | &pound;15,000 |
| Ceiling track hoists | &pound;25,000 |
| House price differential | &pound;200,000+ |
| Total | &pound;300,000+ |

Raising any money at all increases our options. There are very few houses on
the market that are suitable. If I can raise some money to help, this gives us
a chance to consider the more expensive houses that are on the market. We've
seen houses that *might* work costing anywhere from &pound;500,000 to
&pound;1.5m!

Most houses aren't already adapted, so there are the costs for that, which
could be around &pound;100,000. This is all a **lot** more than I have in my
piggy bank! {{<icon class="fa fa-money">}} *Any* amount I
can raise widens our options.

Here's a good example of a house that's *almost* right. It's not quite in the
right area, and it might require some sound insulation, but you get the idea.
The asking price is &pound;600,000. Our house is worth about half that!
