We're scratching our heads how to do this! Bridging finance would allow us to
purchase and own the new house for a period before the sale completed on our
current house. This would give us chance to undertake the necessary work before
moving in.

Bridging finance is not cheap. Neither are the many things we will probably
need to do to the new house (many of which we had done to our current house).
We will probably apply for a Disabled Facilities Grant, but even if our
application is successful, it might not cover all the necessary works.

Here is a list of the costs we *guess* we will incur, in finding a suitable new
home (remember that but for my addtitional needs, we would not be moving):

| Item | Estimated cost |
| :- | -: |
| Removal costs | &pound;3,000 |
| Wheelchair accessible paths | &pound;3,500 |
| Adaptations for James | &pound;4,000 |
| Doorway widening | &pound;5,000 |
| Ramped access | &pound;5,000 |
| Legal fees | &pound;5,000 |
| Estate agents' fees | &pound;5,000 |
| Wheelchair accessible garden room | &pound;7,500 |
| Facilitate parking for care staff | &pound;7,500 |
| Ceiling track hoists | &pound;12,500 |
| Stamp duty | &pound;12,500 |
| Wet room | &pound;15,000 |
| **Bridging loan (3 months)** | **&pound;15,000** |
| Renovations budget | &pound;25,000 |
| House price differential | &pound;200,000 |
| Total | &pound;325,500 |

Of all these, the bridging finance is the crucial piece of the puzzle. We do
know not at this stage if we would qualify or if it would be possible to borrow
such an amount for so long. But it's the best idea we've had so far!

So to recap, we think the new house will cost around &pound;500,000 and the
additional expenses will be in the order of &pound;100,000. That's a **lot**
more than we have in our piggy banks! {{<icon class="fa fa-wheelchair-alt">}}
*Any* amount we can raise reduces the amount of debt needed to transform this
new home from a dream to reality.
