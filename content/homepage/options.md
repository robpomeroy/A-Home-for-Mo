We're scratching our heads how to do this! Bridging finance would allow us to
purchase and own the new house for a period before the sale completed on our
current house. This would give us chance to undertake the necessary work before
moving in.

Bridging finance is not cheap. Neither are the many things we will probably
need to do to the new house (many of which we had done to our current house).
We will probably apply for a Disabled Facilities Grant, but even if our
application is successful, it would not cover all the necessary works.

Here is a list of the costs we *guess* we will incur, by virtue of finding a
suitable new home:

| Item | Estimated cost |
| :- | -: |
| Wheelchair accessible paths | £3,500 |
| Adaptations for James | £4,000 |
| Doorway widening | £5,000 |
| Ramped access | £5,000 |
| Wheelchair accessible garden room | £7,500 |
| Facilitate parking for care staff | £7,500 |
| Ceiling track hoists | £12,500 |
| Wet room | £15,000 |
| **Bridging loan (3 months)** | **£15,000** |
| Renovations budget | £25,000 |
| House price differential | £200,000 |
| Total | £300,000 |

Of all these, the bridging finance is the crucial piece of the puzzle. We do
know not at this stage if we would qualify or if it would be possible to borrow
such an amount for so long. But it's the best idea we've had so far!

So to recap, we think the new house will cost around £500,000 and the necessary
works will amount to £100,000. That's a **lot** more than we have in our piggy
banks! *Any* amount we can raise reduces the amount of debt needed to transform
this new home from a dream to reality.
