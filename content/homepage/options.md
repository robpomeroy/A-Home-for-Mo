We're all scratching our heads how to do this! Bridging finance would allow my
parents to buy new house *before* the sale completed on the currrent house. This
would give a chance to complete the essential work before I move in.

Bridging finance is not cheap. Neither are the many things I will need done to
do to the new house (many of which were done for my current home). Disabled
Facilities Grant are normally an option, but it's only possible to apply for a
grant once you have a house to move into. The grant process moves too slowly
compared to the house moving process, so it's unlikely the timescales will line
up. We will however still pursue this option, in the hope it will cover some of
the costs.

You'll remember that but for my addtitional needs, my family would not be
moving. Here is an estimate of some the costs of finding me a suitable new home:

| Item | Estimated cost |
| :- | -: |
| Adaptations for James | &pound;5,000 |
| Wheelchair accessible paths | &pound;7,500 |
| Doorway widening | &pound;7,500 |
| Wheelchair accessible garden room | &pound;7,500 |
| Facilitate parking for care staff | &pound;7,500 |
| Ramped access | &pound;10,000 |
| Wet room | &pound;15,000 |
| **Bridging loan (3 months)** | **&pound;15,000** |
| Ceiling track hoists | &pound;25,000 |
| House price differential | &pound;200,000 |
| Total | &pound;300,000 |

Of all these, the bridging finance is the crucial piece of the puzzle. It's not
certain if it will be possible to borrow such an amount for so long. But it's
our best idea so far! {{<icon class="fa fa-line-chart">}}

So to recap, the new house probably will cost at least &pound;500,000 and the
additional expenses may be around &pound;100,000. That's a **lot** more than I
have in my piggy bank! {{<icon class="fa fa-wheelchair-alt">}} *Any* amount I
can raise reduces the amount of debt needed to transform this new home from a
dream to reality.
