We're scratching our heads how to do this! Here are some options:

##### Option 1: rent temporary accommodation

*Additional cost ~ £284,000. Practicality: impossible?*

We don't really like the idea of renting temporarily, because it would mean
having to move twice. Moving *once* is going to be difficult enough! Here's
what this option might look like:

| Item | Cost |
| :- | -: |
| New home | £500,000 |
| Adaptations | £100,000 |
| Extra removal costs | £3,000 |
| Three months' rental | £4,500 |
| Storage costs | £1,500 |
| Less current home | *-£325,000* |
| Total | £284,000 |

Pros:

* No need to own (and have the costs of owning) two properties at once

Cons:

* The huge disruption of moving twice (this would be especially difficult for my
  brother)
* We could not install ceiling track hoists in a rental property (mobile hoists
  are impractical due to the level of my spasticity, needing about five people
  to operate - seriously!)
* Unless purpose built/adpated, it would not be particularly wheelchair-friendly
* Need to find a buyer prepared to leave weeks or months between exchange and
  completion

There *may* be a suitable property with hoists already installed, that's
wheelchair accessible?

##### Option 2: bridging finance

*Additional cost ~ £293,000. Practicality: uncertain*

Raising a bridging loan could enable us to buy a new house and spend two or
three months undertaking the adaptations before moving in. This would depend on:

* Finding a buyer for our house who was willing to wait this long before moving
  in - leaving three months between exchange of contracts and completion.
* Finding a lender willing to provide this sort of finance on these terms.

| Item | Cost |
| :- | -: |
| New home | £500,000 |
| Adaptations | £100,000 |
| Extra removal costs | £3,000 |
| Three months' bridging finance | £15,000 |
| Less current home | *-£325,000* |
| Total | £293,000 |

Pros:

* No need to own (and have the costs of owning) two properties at once
* There should be time to adapt the property to my needs before we move
* Only need to move once

Cons:

* Bridging finance *feels* like money for nothing (even if it isn't!)
* Need to find a buyer prepared to leave weeks or months between exchange and
  completion

##### Audacious option 3: fund all costs outright

*Additional cost ~ £600,0000. Practicality: la la land?*

Could we raise the full cost of buying a house and adapting it? My dad tells me
that some businesses call this a "moon shot" {{<icon class="fa fa-moon">}} or a
"big hairy audacious goal". It's a lot of money.

| Item | Cost |
| :- | -: |
| New home | £500,000 |
| Adaptations | £100,000 |
| Less current home | *-£325,000* |
| Total | £600,000 |

Pros:

* The option involves the least stress and disruption to the family; being able
  to move straight into a finished house would be amazing
* We could rent out or later on sell our original house, to help with the
  ongoing costs of my care
* There would be no pressure to complete adapatation works within a fixed time
* Only need to move once

Cons:

* Very, very expensive!
* My Mum and Dad would spend a lot of time weeping with gratitude
