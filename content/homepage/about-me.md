##### Hello!

My identical twin James and I {{<icon class="fa fa-male">}}
{{<icon class="fa fa-male">}} were born in 2004, 10 weeks early. We are
survivors of [twin-to-twin transfusion
syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-to-twin_transfusion_syndrome).
Because of this condition, I am profoundly disabled
{{<icon class="fa fa-wheelchair-alt">}} , quadriplegic with severe spastic
cerebral palsy, epilepsy and profound learning difficulties. We live with our Mum
&amp; Dad in Chester in the UK.

##### Highs {{<icon class="fa fa-thumbs-up">}} and Lows {{<icon class="fa fa-thumbs-down">}}

Like many people, I have a mixed life. I smile a lot
{{<icon class="fa fa-smile-o">}} and I love cuddles
{{<icon class="fa fa-heart">}}. But sometimes life is very difficult.
{{<icon class="fa fa-frown-o">}} My body is in constant tension because of the
severity of my condition. And I have a lot of seizures. It hurts a lot, but my
Mum and Dad tell me I'm very brave.

I love being with my friends and family - especially my brother James. He has
severe learning difficults and is on the autistic spectrum. He makes me laugh.
Like a lot of identical twins, we have a very special bond.
