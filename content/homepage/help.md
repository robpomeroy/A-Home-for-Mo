To do any of this, I'm going to need help. Help from our family, friends and
strangers. There's no getting round it: the things I most need, to find this
new home and keep my family together, are love and money. (Not
[love *of* money](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim+6%3A10&version=ESVUK)
though!)

#### What you can do to help

I would love it if you could:

* Get the word out by sending a <a href="https://twitter.com/share?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-share-button" data-size="large" data-text="Please help find a home for Mo!" data-url="https://ahomeformo.pomeroy.me" data-via="robpomeroy" data-hashtags="ahomeformo" data-show-count="false">Tweet</a><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> to your followers.
* Send a donation of any amount via
  [my GoFundMe page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-home-for-mo).
* Contribute artwork, graphic design or web skills, to make this site more
  beautiful. My dad's a geek, not an artist, bless him.
* If you have connections with charities or media outlets, tell them my story -
  perhaps they can help or spread the word?
* Tell your friends, family and colleagues about me!

##### Pledges
