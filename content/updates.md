title: "Campaign updates"

## Saturday, 18 December 2021

A **lot** has happened since our last update - including the whole family
catching COVID. We put our house on the market in September and agreed a sale
in about a week. After that, the pressure was on to find the new home.

With very little on the market, even less that was suitable, we placed an offer,
which was then accepted, on a lovely house in Mickle Trafford, a village just
outside Chester. This house has a detached double garage, which we plan to
covert into Morgan's quarters. And there's a gap of about 12 feet/3.7 metres
between the garage and the house, where we will build a new staff/kitchen/store
room.

Originally, we'd hoped to do the work before moving in, but with planning
applications taking 6 months, we could not ask our buyers or seller to wait
that long. Our plan B is to use the lounge temporarily as Morgan's bedroom,
while we complete the other works. This takes off some of the time pressure.

This leaves us still with many things to plan and organise, and much paperwork
to complete (including a Disabled Facilities Grant application). We're doing
our best to contain the stress. Any move is stressful after all, and this move
doubly so.

If all goes to plan, we will own the new house in late February, using bridging
finance (that part hasn't changed). That gives us time to do some basic
modifications for the interim plan: wheelchair accessible doorways, and
ceiling track hoist. We expect the sale of our existing property to complete at
the end of March.

Having walked such a strange journey over the last 12 months, the next phase
now feels alarmingly close. Once Christmas is done, the packing will start and
we'll be in the new house before we know it, God willing. At the same time,
we're able to visualise and start planning Morgan's living quarters and therapy
space. We feel a strong sense of responsibility to put the fundraising to the
best possible use, for Morgan's benefit.

It's getting real.

- Almost all the work on our current home is finished.
- New hall, stairs and landing carpet to be fitted shortly.
- Existing home goes on the market in a fortnight.
- We viewed two potential new homes yesterday - one is a very strong contender.
- The strong contender involves some compromise - mainly that it has a very
  small garden. But the layout is the best we've seen so far (although some
  structural work will still be needed).
- We've raised (*you* have raised!) nearly &pound;80k so far. We will apply
  every penny as wisely as we are able, to make the new home the best we can for
  Morgan & James.

The housing market normally picks up in September, so we may see some more
possible homes entering the market. We are excited and apprehensive. Challenges
include:

- Finding a home that ticks even more boxes (if it exists).
- Finding a buyer for our current home who is prepared to wait while we adapt
  the new one.
- Managing the logistics around Morgan's care during the day(s) of the move.

In other news, some more funding has been approved to increase the amount of
care Morgan receives. We're heading towards two-to-one care, 24/7, but we're not
there yet. With the increase, our wonderful care package team now need to find
and train up staff to provide the funded cover - which is no small feat.

There are hurdles ahead, but with your love and support, we can face them
head-on.

**Good news, hot off the press -  in more ways than one.**

[![Sunday Times](/images/2021-08-01_SundayTimes-crop.jpg)](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/we-raised-80k-to-give-morgan-a-better-life-banks-wont-let-us-spend-it-gj9nf723p)

You may have seen
[our story in the Sunday Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/we-raised-80k-to-give-morgan-a-better-life-banks-wont-let-us-spend-it-gj9nf723p)
at the weekend. To our utter astonishment, it was the lead story in the Money
section. The journalist [Imogen Tew](https://twitter.com/imogent_) did a great
job, covering the issue we referred to in our last update: that mortgage lenders
would not permit us to apply any of the funds raised towards a deposit on a
purchase.

Earlier today, local charity
[the Steve Morgan Foundation](https://stevemorganfoundation.org.uk/) contacted
us to say that they might be able to help. They were willing to transform the
funds raised into a grant, together with any paperwork necessary to satisfy a
lender that there were no strings attached. In addition, they have offered
to help with the costs of adaptation. What a mind-blowing double offer! The
funds transformation idea is great to have as an option, for when we start
looking in earnest for Morgan's home (probably in September).

And then more good news: I (Rob) have just come off the phone to Imogen. A
contact at the Halifax has been in touch with her. The Halifax has reconsidered
our situation in the light of her article. As a result, they are now able to
confirm that the fund raising would *not* be barred from use as a deposit.

What a result! It is our sincere hope that other lenders will follow suit.

Practically for us, it means that once more, any funds raised can extend our
reach towards the more expensive properties. So although we are not far off the
"official" AHFM fundraising goal, there is no limit to the amount that can be
applied to help Morgan - to help his bamboozled parents find the best home we
can for Mo and his brother James: two very precious boys.

Thank you Imogen. You rock.

## Thursday, 15 July 2021

We made an interesting &amp; slightly awkward discovery in the last fortnight.
Due to increasing regulation in the finance sector, residential lenders make
more queries than ever about the source of funds for a deposit. It turns out
they will not accept funds raised through campaigns like this!

We had previously believed that any spare funds raised (beyond what’s needed for
adaptations) could “extend our reach”, to slightly more expensive properties.
But it appears that would only be possible if we weren’t ALSO taking on a
mortgage. So if we had indeed raised our previous target of &pound;300k, and
only needed &pound;100k for adaptations, I’m not sure what we would do with the
excess &pound;200k if we couldn’t spend it. Send it back again?!

To cut a long, slightly confusing story short, we are lowering the fundraising
target. It’s a very weird situation and we are of course still complete amateurs
at this.

Meanwhile, thanks to everyone for the continuing support and for sticking with
us. We’re a lot closer to being ready to sell our current house. We’ve had some
slight setbacks (including Morgan needing an overnight stay in hospital this
week - he’s okay now), but there’s a chance we’ll still be ready to go on the
market in September.

Love from all of us, Rob, Sharon, Mo &amp; James

PS Near the start of this journey, Rob had vaguely wondered how frequently
criminals might attempt to use fundraising sites to launder money. Based on the
above, attempts are perhaps all too common.

Hi!

We're probably overdue an update. In today's update, we'll focus on our missions.

* Mission 1: find the funds
* Mission 2: ready to sell
* Mission 3: find the house
* Mission 4: ready to move

Thank you once more to everyone who is so generously helping us with mission 1
(find the funds). The fundraising stands at nearly &pound;75,000, which is awesome.

Over the last few weeks, we've been beavering away at mission 2 (get ready to
sell). We've made great progress, tidying, smartening up the house and
decluttering.

Much decluttering has been needed, especially in the loft. We've lived in our
current home for nearly fourteen years, during a period where we've had
decreasing capacity for anything beyond basic survival and meeting our boys'
needs. And that really showed in the state of our loft! The easiest option for
so many things has been "just put it in the loft for now."

That has meant the loft has held many things, e.g.:

* Ornaments we put away during James' most destructive phases when he was
  younger (and which we didn't get out again)
* Pictures that we brought from our last home and just haven't got round to
  putting up
* Things we've put in the loft to make space for all Morgan's supplies (CDs,
  DVDs, spare bedding and even two dining chairs!)
* Things we thought we might need one day
* Things that gave us decision paralysis

It's not just the loft. Over the last few months I have scanned and shredded
thousands of documents. Going paperless releases space and reduces clutter.
We're quite close to being able to part with our two-drawer filing cabinet,
which a few months ago was bursting at the seams, with unfiled paperwork hiding
All Over The House.

Mission 2 also includes replacing our roof. It needed doing. It would have come
up on a survey. Replacing it will absolutely increase the "wow" factor. On
balance, we think it's well worthwhile.

We're also repainting various rooms. The hall, stairs and landing are finally
done (after being half-done for an embarrassing number of years). The lounge is
being painted this week. Sharon is painting the kitchen. And we're planning to
paint the exterior of the house too, which really has needed doing since we
moved in. (We apologise profusely to our long-suffering neighbours!)

We're working on mission 3 (find the house). We actually went to view a house
today. Very interesting, but we're not sure if we can make the space work. If
it's still on the market when we're finally ready to sell, we'll almost
certainly go back for another look and to measure up carefully.

We have active searches on Rightmove, OnTheMarket and Zoopla. Even with really
tight search parameters, still the vast majority of properties that come up are
unsuitable. If you know of a property in the Chester area that may be suitable
that is NOT on the market, please let us know: [ahfm@pomeroy.me](mailto:ahfm@pomeroy.me).

Mission 4 (get ready to move) involves preparing the new house for Morgan and
James. We can't yet predict what that will entail. That depends on the outcome
of mission 3.

So: we've come a long way and there's a long way yet to go. We are facing many
challenging decisions, often which have no "right" answer (that's life, isn't
it)! We need wisdom, patience and clarity. If you pray, do pray for us?

Thank you so much for following us on this journey. We literally could not do it
without you.

God bless,

Rob & Sharon

Sharon and I had a great (nerve-wracking) opportunity to speak live on UCB this
morning about special needs parenting and the ongoing campaign to raise money
towards a home for Morgan.

This interview focuses a *lot* on our faith and how it affects our story. If
that's not your jam, we understand, no problem. {{<icon class="fa fa-heart">}}

Thank you UCB and to all those who made this happen! We have some further
possible opportunities to tell our story in the media - we'll let you know if
they come to fruition.

![thank you](/images/thank-you.jpg)

We launched the fundraising campaign yesterday, not at all knowing what to
expect. We had set the target at &pound;15,000, and that felt audacious. As I
posted the links to social media, I was thinking something I've said to a few
friends recently, as we discussed this idea: "Nothing ventured, nothing gained."

What did I think would happen? I wasn't sure, but in my heart of hearts, I
thought maybe we'd raise a few thousand pounds, and that would be amazing.

Doubting Thomas.

At one point yesterday, I quipped, "I'm battered and bruised from how often I've
fallen off my chair today."

Just astonishing. Every gift, regardless of size, blew me away. I tried to thank
every donor personally, as gifts came in but I couldn't keep up. In less than a
day, thanks to the kindness of people we know and people we don't know (how is
that even possible!), we had raised the full &pound;15,000 and then some.

But more than that, people were telling us, "Be bold", "Aim higher"! So this
morning, with feelings I can't even begin to describe, I've raised the target,
setting it to an amount that expands our options significantly, to make this
project happen. Will we meet that target? I have absolutely no idea. Yesterday I
might have said "Not a chance!" Today I am humbled, thankful and ready to wait
and see.

The last 16+ years of our boys' lives have been quite a journey. Like many
parents of children with special needs, we find this to be a rollercoaster.
Without doubt, yesterday was one of the highs, beyond our wildest expectations.
We are grateful to you and we are grateful to God who has sustained us
throughout.

These two little words seem far too small for the occasion. And yet they are
the truest thing we can say right now: **thank you**.
