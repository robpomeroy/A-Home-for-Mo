title: "Campaign updates"

## Thursday, 15 July 2021

We made an interesting &amp; slightly awkward discovery in the last fortnight.
Due to increasing regulation in the finance sector, residential lenders make
more queries than ever about the source of funds for a deposit. It turns out
they will not accept funds raised through campaigns like this!

We had previously believed that any spare funds raised (beyond what’s needed for
adaptations) could “extend our reach”, to slightly more expensive properties.
But it appears that would only be possible if we weren’t ALSO taking on a
mortgage. So if we had indeed raised &pound;300k, and only needed &pound;100k
for adaptations, I’m not sure what we would do with the excess &pound;200k if we
couldn’t spend it. Send it back again?!

To cut a long, slightly confusing story short, we are lowering the fund raising
target. It’s a very weird situation and we are of course still complete amateurs
at this.

Meanwhile, thanks to everyone for the continuing support and for sticking with
us. We’re a lot closer to being ready to sell our current house. We’ve had some
slight setbacks (including Morgan needing an overnight stay in hospital this
week - he’s okay now), but there’s a chance we’ll still be ready to go on the
market in September.

Love from all of us, Rob, Sharon, Mo &amp; James

PS Near the start of this journey, Rob had vaguely wondered how frequently
criminals might attempt to use fundraising sites to launder money. Based on the
above, attempts are perhaps all too common.

Hi!

We're probably overdue an update. In today's update, we'll focus on our missions.

* Mission 1: find the funds
* Mission 2: ready to sell
* Mission 3: find the house
* Mission 4: ready to move

Thank you once more to everyone who is so generously helping us with mission 1
(find the funds). The fundraising stands at nearly &pound;75,000, which is awesome.

Over the last few weeks, we've been beavering away at mission 2 (get ready to
sell). We've made great progress, tidying, smartening up the house and
decluttering.

Much decluttering has been needed, especially in the loft. We've lived in our
current home for nearly fourteen years, during a period where we've had
decreasing capacity for anything beyond basic survival and meeting our boys'
needs. And that really showed in the state of our loft! The easiest option for
so many things has been "just put it in the loft for now."

That has meant the loft has held many things, e.g.:

* Ornaments we put away during James' most destructive phases when he was
  younger (and which we didn't get out again)
* Pictures that we brought from our last home and just haven't got round to
  putting up
* Things we've put in the loft to make space for all Morgan's supplies (CDs,
  DVDs, spare bedding and even two dining chairs!)
* Things we thought we might need one day
* Things that gave us decision paralysis

It's not just the loft. Over the last few months I have scanned and shredded
thousands of documents. Going paperless releases space and reduces clutter.
We're quite close to being able to part with our two-drawer filing cabinet,
which a few months ago was bursting at the seams, with unfiled paperwork hiding
All Over The House.

Mission 2 also includes replacing our roof. It needed doing. It would have come
up on a survey. Replacing it will absolutely increase the "wow" factor. On
balance, we think it's well worthwhile.

We're also repainting various rooms. The hall, stairs and landing are finally
done (after being half-done for an embarrassing number of years). The lounge is
being painted this week. Sharon is painting the kitchen. And we're planning to
paint the exterior of the house too, which really has needed doing since we
moved in. (We apologise profusely to our long-suffering neighbours!)

We're working on mission 3 (find the house). We actually went to view a house
today. Very interesting, but we're not sure if we can make the space work. If
it's still on the market when we're finally ready to sell, we'll almost
certainly go back for another look and to measure up carefully.

We have active searches on Rightmove, OnTheMarket and Zoopla. Even with really
tight search parameters, still the vast majority of properties that come up are
unsuitable. If you know of a property in the Chester area that may be suitable
that is NOT on the market, please let us know: [ahfm@pomeroy.me](mailto:ahfm@pomeroy.me).

Mission 4 (get ready to move) involves preparing the new house for Morgan and
James. We can't yet predict what that will entail. That depends on the outcome
of mission 3.

So: we've come a long way and there's a long way yet to go. We are facing many
challenging decisions, often which have no "right" answer (that's life, isn't
it)! We need wisdom, patience and clarity. If you pray, do pray for us?

Thank you so much for following us on this journey. We literally could not do it
without you.

God bless,

Rob & Sharon

Sharon and I had a great (nerve-wracking) opportunity to speak live on UCB this
morning about special needs parenting and the ongoing campaign to raise money
towards a home for Morgan.

This interview focuses a *lot* on our faith and how it affects our story. If
that's not your jam, we understand, no problem. {{<icon class="fa fa-heart">}}
You can listen to the show using the embedded player above, or by following

Thank you UCB and to all those who made this happen! We have some further
possible opportunities to tell our story in the media - we'll let you know if
they come to fruition.

![thank you](/images/thank-you.jpg)

We launched the fundraising campaign yesterday, not at all knowing what to
expect. We had set the target at &pound;15,000, and that felt audacious. As I
posted the links to social media, I was thinking something I've said to a few
friends recently, as we discussed this idea: "Nothing ventured, nothing gained."

What did I think would happen? I wasn't sure, but in my heart of hearts, I
thought maybe we'd raise a few thousand pounds, and that would be amazing.

Doubting Thomas.

At one point yesterday, I quipped, "I'm battered and bruised from how often I've
fallen off my chair today."

Just astonishing. Every gift, regardless of size, blew me away. I tried to thank
every donor personally, as gifts came in but I couldn't keep up. In less than a
day, thanks to the kindness of people we know and people we don't know (how is
that even possible!), we had raised the full &pound;15,000 and then some.

But more than that, people were telling us, "Be bold", "Aim higher"! So this
morning, with feelings I can't even begin to describe, I've raised the target,
setting it to an amount that expands our options significantly, to make this
project happen. Will we meet that target? I have absolutely no idea. Yesterday I
might have said "Not a chance!" Today I am humbled, thankful and ready to wait
and see.

The last 16+ years of our boys' lives have been quite a journey. Like many
parents of children with special needs, we find this to be a rollercoaster.
Without doubt, yesterday was one of the highs, beyond our wildest expectations.
We are grateful to you and we are grateful to God who has sustained us
throughout.

These two little words seem far too small for the occasion. And yet they are
the truest thing we can say right now: **thank you**.
