## Adapted housing

Despite recent improvements in
[UK buildings policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/housing-for-older-and-disabled-people),
the vast majority of housing stock is unsuitable for wheelchair users. Necessary
adaptations often include:

* Widening doorways
* Providing ramped access - into the house and within multi-level gardens
* Facilitating sufficient single-level (downstairs) accommodation - this may
  include sacrificing a reception room to create a downstairs bedroom, for
  example
* Replacing stepped thresholds (e.g. UPVC doorways with a raised frame at the
  bottom) with level
* Providing sufficient parking for carers (particularly important in congested
  city areas)

Pressures on land prices have driven builders to cram more housing onto the
same footprint. This means fewer bungalows and more multi-floor housing, with
three-storey housing becoming an increasingly common option in the UK. This
housing is rarely built such that a wheelchair user could access more than one
floor.

We are not aware of a single charity focusing on this area. Rather
[several charities](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=campaign+for+accessible+housing)
consider the problem, within their duties to their beneficiaries.

At the local government level, much policymaking is discretionary. Campaigners
can therefore achieve significant improvements by contacting local councillors
and planning officers, and reminding them of accessibility needs.

General rant: is there any reason why disability adaptations can't be
attractive?

## TTTS

Morgan and James are survivors of
[Twin-to-Twin-Transfusion syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-to-twin_transfusion_syndrome).
This condition can only occur in identical twin pregnancies and involves
incomplete splitting of the placenta. This means that some blood, carrying
oxygen and nutrion flows from one twin to the other, instead only from mother to
baby. This effectively means that one of the twins receives secondhand blood.

Mo and James were born in 2004. Medicine has improved since then, but
treatment (e.g.
[laser therapy](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg198/resources/treatment-of-twintotwin-transfusion-syndrome-with-intrauterine-laser-ablation-306074989)
remains risky and expensive. Without help, there is a very serious risk that
one or both babies will die before birth - or even if they survive, they may
be extremely unwell and/or disabled. TTTS babies tend to be delivered
prematurely and are often sicker than other babies born prematurely. More work
is needed to improve survival rates and outcomes.

If you are concerned about this condition, please consider supporting the
[Twins trust TTTS Appeal](https://twinstrust.org/get-involved/appeals/ttts-appeal.html).
There are several [Facebook support groups](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=twin+to+twin+transfusion+syndrome+facebook)
you may wish to connect with, if affected by this condition personally.
