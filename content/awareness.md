Morgan and James are survivors of
[Twin-to-Twin-Transfusion syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-to-twin_transfusion_syndrome).
This condition, which can only occur in monozygotic pregnancies (single egg,
such as with identical twins). It involves incomplete splitting of the placenta,
such that some blood passes from one twin to the other, rather than only from
mother to baby.

Mo and James were born in 2004. Medical technology and possible interventions
have developed and improved in the intervening period, but the procedures that
may assist (e.g.
[laser therapy](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg198/resources/treatment-of-twintotwin-transfusion-syndrome-with-intrauterine-laser-ablation-306074989)
remain risky and costly. Further work in this area will help improve survival
rates and outcomes for identical twin pregnancies faced with this condition.

If you are concerned about this condition, please consider supporting the
[Twins trust TTTS Appeal](https://twinstrust.org/get-involved/appeals/ttts-appeal.html).
There are several [Facebook support groups](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=twin+to+twin+transfusion+syndrome+facebook)
you may wish to connect with, if affected by this condition personally.

## Adapted housing

Despite recent improvements in
[UK buildings policy](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/housing-for-older-and-disabled-people),
the vast majority of housing stock is unsuitable for wheelchair users. Necessary
adaptations often include:

* Widening doorways
* Providing ramped access - into the house and within multi-level gardens
* Facilitating sufficient single-level (downstairs) accommodation - this may
  include sacrificing a reception room to create a downstairs bedroom, for
  example
* Replacing stepped thresholds (e.g. UPVC doorways with a raised frame at the
  bottom) with level
* Providing sufficient parking for carers (particularly important in congested
  city areas)

Pressures on land prices have driven builders to cram more housing onto the
same footprint. This means fewer bungalows and more multi-floor housing, with
three-storey housing becoming an increasingly common option in the UK. This
housing is rarely built such that a wheelchair user could access more than one
floor.

We are not aware of a single charity focusing on this area. Rather
[several charities](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=campaign+for+accessible+housing)
consider the problem, within their duties to their beneficiaries.

At the local government level, much policymaking is discretionary. Campaigners
can therefore achieve significant improvements by contacting local councillors
and planning officers, and reminding them of accessibility needs.

General rant: is there any reason why disability adaptations can't be
attractive?
