# Hello!

My identical twin James and I :(fa fa-male): :(fa fa-male):
were born in 2004, 10 weeks early. We are
survivors of [twin-to-twin transfusion
syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-to-twin_transfusion_syndrome).
Because of this condition, I am profoundly disabled
:(fa fa-wheelchair-alt):, quadriplegic with severe spastic
cerebral palsy, epilepsy and profound learning difficulties. We live with our
Mum &amp; Dad in Chester in the UK.

# Highs :(fa fa-thumbs-up): and Lows :(fa fa-thumbs-down):

Like many people, I have a mixed life. I smile a lot :(fa fa-smile): and I
love cuddles :(fa fa-heart):. But sometimes life is very difficult.
:(fas fa-frown): My body is in constant tension because of the severity of my
condition. And I have seizures most days. It hurts a lot, but my Mum and Dad
tell me I'm very brave.

I love being with my friends and family - especially my brother James. He has
severe learning difficulties and is on the autistic spectrum. He makes me laugh.
Like a lot of identical twins, we have a very special bond.

Morgan and James are survivors of
[Twin-to-Twin-Transfusion syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-to-twin_transfusion_syndrome).
This condition can only occur in identical twin pregnancies and involves
incomplete splitting of the placenta. This means that some blood, carrying
oxygen and nutrion flows from one twin to the other, instead only from mother to
baby. This effectively means that one of the twins receives secondhand blood.

Mo and James were born in 2004. Medicine has improved since then, but
treatment (e.g.
[laser therapy](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg198/resources/treatment-of-twintotwin-transfusion-syndrome-with-intrauterine-laser-ablation-306074989))
remains risky and expensive. Without help, there is a very serious risk that
one or both babies will die before birth - or even if they survive, they may
be extremely unwell and/or disabled. TTTS babies tend to be delivered
prematurely and are often sicker than other babies born prematurely. More work
is needed to improve survival rates and outcomes.

If you are concerned about this condition, please consider supporting the
[Twins trust TTTS Appeal](https://twinstrust.org/get-involved/appeals/ttts-appeal.html).
There are several [Facebook support groups](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=twin+to+twin+transfusion+syndrome+facebook)
you may wish to connect with, if affected by this condition personally.
