I live with my family in Chester, England. As I've grown older, and needed more
and more help, our previous house became too small for me. I now have two carers
with me, round the clock. I needed more space for my supplies, my equipment and
my carers. And it's important to keep my family together. So my mum and dad
workied hard to find us a new home.

## Why a new home?

It's important for me to be near my parents and especially my brother (what can
I say - he needs me!). They know me best and what I need. So I have to have my
family around me. But I also need my carers.

And I've never been able to have friends round to my house. There just wasn't
enough room for all the wheelchairs! It will be amazing to have space for them
to visit and perhaps watch a film or enjoy some music therapy together.

Home is the best place for me where I have everything I need. It's like having a
hospital in my home. And for a hospital, you need a **lot** of space. Space for
my two wheelchairs :(fa fa-wheelchair): :(fa fa-wheelchair):, all my
supplies, my special bed :(fa fa-bed): and bath :(fa fa-bath):, my hoists -
everything.

The bath has always been one of my happiest places. I have a very special bath,
which goes up and down for my carers. It cost &pound;11,000 (!) and has a spa
function which I *love*. The bath was installed in our last house and is waiting
reinstallation in our new home.

## Privacy

Though we all want to live together, it can be difficult for the rest of my
family, when there are carers in the home all day and all night. It makes it
hard to have a private family life. Sometimes I'm noisy at night and wake
everyone up. My mum is basically a superhero :(fa fa-mask):.
But even superheroes need to sleep.

## The new house

In March 2021, we moved into our new home, in a temporary arrangement. There is
a double garage that will be turned into an annex for me, and there will be a
new room, for my carers and my equipment. In the meantime, I am using the lounge
as my bedroom. Building work started in July 2023, after a long wait for
planning permission.

The phenomenal fundraising efforts of my family and friends have made this
possible. We have used some of the money for a few things so far, including:

- Installing wheelchair-accessible external doors
- Relocating meters (out of the double garage, which will be my bedroom)
- Funding the bridging loan (so we could briefly have two houses at once)
- Initial essential renovations
- Architect's &amp; structural engineer's fees
- Removal costs

Things left to do:

- Convert the double garage into my bedroom/bathroom
- Build the new room for staff and facilities
- Widen internal doorways for my wheelchair

Thank you so much to everyone who donated. I look forward to telling you when my
new annex is ready!
