<li><strong>Interest-free loan</strong>: to our utter astonishment some very kind friends have
offered, in place of bridging finance, an interest-free loan. This could
enable us to complete the purchase of the new home before we complete the
sale of our current home - <em>without</em> recourse to expensive finance.</li>
<li><strong>Fundraising show</strong>: our good friend

renowned after-dinner speaker and Chester&rsquo;s own Town Crier, has amazingly
offered to put on a show, with all profits being donated to this cause. The
show is in the process of being arranged; details to follow. Oh, David asked
me to point out his dazzling good looks.</li>
