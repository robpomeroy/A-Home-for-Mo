<p>We launched the fundraising campaign yesterday, not at all knowing what to
expect. We had set the target at £15,000, and that felt audacious. As I
posted the links to social media, I was thinking something I&rsquo;ve said to a few
friends recently, as we discussed this idea: &ldquo;Nothing ventured, nothing gained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What did I think would happen? I wasn&rsquo;t sure, but in my heart of hearts, I
thought maybe we&rsquo;d raise a few thousand pounds, and that would be amazing.</p>
<p>Doubting Thomas.</p>
<p>At one point yesterday, I quipped, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m battered and bruised from how often I&rsquo;ve
fallen off my chair today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just astonishing. Every gift, regardless of size, blew me away. I tried to thank
every donor personally, as gifts came in but I couldn&rsquo;t keep up. In less than a
day, thanks to the kindness of people we know and people we don&rsquo;t know (how is
that even possible!), we had raised the full £15,000 and then some.</p>
<p>But more than that, people were telling us, &ldquo;Be bold&rdquo;, &ldquo;Aim higher&rdquo;! So this
morning, with feelings I can&rsquo;t even begin to describe, I&rsquo;ve raised the target,
setting it to an amount that expands our options significantly, to make this
project happen. Will we meet that target? I have absolutely no idea. Yesterday I
might have said &ldquo;Not a chance!&rdquo; Today I am humbled, thankful and ready to wait
and see.</p>
<p>The last 16+ years of our boys' lives have been quite a journey. Like many
parents of children with special needs, we find this to be a rollercoaster.
Without doubt, yesterday was one of the highs, beyond our wildest expectations.
We are grateful to you and we are grateful to God who has sustained us
throughout.</p>
<p>These two little words seem far too small for the occasion. And yet they are
the truest thing we can say right now: <strong>thank you</strong>.</p>
