  Q: What do you most need in a home?
A: Sufficient ground floor space for Mo (bedroom, bathroom, lounge and utility room). Privacy (when required) for the rest of the family. In practice this means annex-style accommodation.
Q: Can&rsquo;t you extend your existing house?
A: We&rsquo;ve looked closely at this and even gone as far as having plans drawn up, a few years ago." />

<p><strong>Q: What do you most need in a home?</strong></p>
<p>A: Sufficient ground floor space for Mo (bedroom, bathroom, lounge and utility
room). Privacy (when required) for the rest of the family. In practice this
means annex-style accommodation.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can&rsquo;t you extend your existing house?</strong></p>
<p>A: We&rsquo;ve looked closely at this and even gone as far as having plans drawn up,
a few years ago. We&rsquo;ve reluctantly concluded that although we love our home,
there&rsquo;s is no way to make it work by extending.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Chester seems expensive. Can&rsquo;t you move somewhere cheaper?</strong></p>
<p>A: We have considered this, but there are many things anchoring us to Chester,
from the boys' school to the specialist medical professionals involved in all
aspects of Mo&rsquo;s care.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do you need so much space?</strong></p>
<p>A: Imagine a box big enough for eight footballs. Then imagine receiving eight or
so such boxes every month. That&rsquo;s the kind of volume of storage we need just for
Morgan&rsquo;s feeding supplies (bottles of his specialised formula milk, flexible
containers, tubing, etc.). Then there&rsquo;s all Morgan&rsquo;s medicine. 20+
prescriptions. His medicine cabinet looks like a pharmacy!</p>

<p>Add to that two large wheelchairs. Maintaining wheelchair access means reducing
available space in any room through which the chairs pass. It&rsquo;s a kind of
corridor effect.</p>
<p>Continence products - pads, wet &amp; dry wipes, sacks, etc., take up a huge
amount of space. By a similar token, Mo needs more outfits/changes of clothes
than most people.</p>
<p>He has a specialised sleep system, to keep him comfortable in bed. Some of his
sensory toys are bulky.</p>
<p>Morgan&rsquo;s living space also has to accommodate the needs of his NHS carers.
Although it&rsquo;s his home, it&rsquo;s their workplace. So this includes things like
fridge space for their food, somewhere for them to sit, space for the manuals
and documentation they maintain as part of their role and so on. Similarly,
they need somewhere to park. And given that Morgan receives night care, it&rsquo;s
preferable that the parking is quite near the house.</p>
<p>The list is endless&hellip;</p>
