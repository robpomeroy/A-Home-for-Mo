<h5 id="hello">Hello!</h5>
<p>My identical twin James and I <i class="fa fa-male"></i>
<i class="fa fa-male"></i> were born in 2004, 10 weeks early. We are
survivors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-to-twin_transfusion_syndrome">twin-to-twin transfusion
syndrome</a>.
Because of this condition, I am profoundly disabled
<i class="fa fa-wheelchair-alt"></i> , quadriplegic with severe spastic
cerebral palsy, epilepsy and profound learning difficulties. We live with our Mum
&amp; Dad in Chester in the UK.</p>
<p><img src="images/family.jpg" alt="my family"></p>
<h5 id="highs-hahahugoshortcode-s3-hbhb-and-lows-hahahugoshortcode-s4-hbhb">Highs <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i> and Lows <i class="fa fa-thumbs-down"></i></h5>
<p>Like many people, I have a mixed life. I smile a lot
<i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i> and I love cuddles
<i class="fa fa-heart"></i>. But sometimes life is very difficult.
<i class="fa fa-frown-o"></i> My body is in constant tension because of the
severity of my condition. And I have a lot of seizures. It hurts a lot, but my
Mum and Dad tell me I&rsquo;m very brave.</p>
<p>I love being with my friends and family - especially my brother James. He has
severe learning difficults and is on the autistic spectrum. He makes me laugh.
Like a lot of identical twins, we have a very special bond.</p>

                <section class="post-content">
                    <p>I live with my family in a lovely home in Chester, England. As I&rsquo;ve grown older,
and needed more and more help, the house has become too small for me. Soon I
will need two-to-one care, 24 hours a day. We need more space for my supplies,
my equipment and my carers. And we need to keep the family together.</p>
<h4 id="why-a-new-home">Why a new home?</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s important for me to be near my parents and especially my brother (what can
I say - he needs me!). They know me best and what I need. So I need my family
around me. But I also need my carers.</p>
<p>Also, I&rsquo;ve never been able to have my friends round. There just isn&rsquo;t enough
room for all the wheelchairs!</p>
<p><img src="images/track-hoist.jpg" alt="a ceiling track hoist"></p>
<p>Home is the best place for me where I have everything I need. It&rsquo;s like having a
hospital in my home. And for a hospital, you need a <strong>lot</strong> of space. Space for
my two wheelchairs <i class="fa fa-wheelchair"></i>
<i class="fa fa-wheelchair-alt"></i>, all my supplies, my special
bed <i class="fa fa-bed"></i> and
bath <i class="fa fa-bath"></i>, my hoists - everything.</p>
<p>The bath has always been one of my happiest places. I have a very special bath,
which goes up and down for my carers. It cost £11,000 (!) and has a spa function
which I <em>love</em>. Fortunately the bath can move with me, though there will be a
relocation fee.</p>
<p><img src="images/astor-bannerman-bath.jpg" alt="specialist height adjustable bath"></p>
<h4 id="privacy">Privacy</h4>
<p>Though we all want to live together, it can be difficult for the rest of my
family, when there are carers in the home all day and all night. It makes it
hard to have a private family life. Sometimes I&rsquo;m noisy at night and wake
everyone up. My mum is basically a superhero <i class="fa fa-superpowers"></i>.
But even superheroes need to sleep.</p>

                    <blockquote>
<p>Being disabled is expensive. Being profoundly disabled is <em>really</em> expensive.
(Remember my £11,000 bath?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have a big problem <i class="fa fa-bug"></i>. Any house I move to
needs to be adapted for me. That can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Widening doorways for my
wheelchair <i class="fa fa-wheelchair-alt"></i></li>
<li>Adding ceiling track hoists</li>
<li>Creating ramped and level access</li>
<li>Installing my specialised bath <i class="fa fa-bath"></i></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/building-work.jpg" alt="building work"></p>
<p>Mum and Dad can&rsquo;t adapt a house while I&rsquo;m living there. They can&rsquo;t afford to
buy another house without selling the existing house. There aren&rsquo;t many places
suitable for me to move to while work is underway and my brother really doesn&rsquo;t
like to be away from me. Staying together is always the best option.</p>
<p>On top of that, moving house once is going to be hard enough (especially since
James struggles with change), but moving twice - once into temporary
accommodation and again into the finished house - is almost unthinkable. The
best option by far is to make the new house ready while we&rsquo;re still living in
the old house. Then we move just once.</p>
<p><img src="images/happy-twins.jpg" alt="building work"></p>
<p>How we do this is our Great Big Problem and it&rsquo;s the reason this website exists.</p>
<h4 id="what-do-i-need">What do I need?</h4>
<p>I need a home:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where my family can stay together</li>
<li>In Chester (it needs to be near
<a href="https://www.deebanksschool.co.uk/">my school</a> <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i>;
my body makes it difficult to go long distances - sometimes I need sedation,
to be able to travel)</li>
<li>Close to my GP, pharmacy and hospital - especially the GP &amp; pharmacy; they
know me well and are good at handling all my many (20+!) prescriptions</li>
<li>With a bedroom and bathroom downstairs for me</li>
<li>With space for my carers</li>
<li>With space for my all supplies and equipment</li>
<li>Ideally, with space for my own washing machine (I won&rsquo;t explain why!)</li>
<li>Where my family can have privacy</li>
</ul>
<p>Houses meeting all these requirements tend to be at least £500,000. In addition,
adaptations could cost another £100,000 or more. This means spending ~ £300,000
more than my current house is worth. Somehow we need to raise that much.</p>

                    <p>We&rsquo;re scratching our heads how to do this! Here are some options:</p>
<h5 id="option-1-rent-temporary-accommodation">Option 1: rent temporary accommodation</h5>
<p><em>Additional cost ~ £284,000. Practicality: impossible?</em></p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really like the idea of renting temporarily, because it would mean
having to move twice. Moving <em>once</em> is going to be difficult enough! Here&rsquo;s
what this option might look like:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>No need to own (and have the costs of owning) two properties at once</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The huge disruption of moving twice (this would be especially difficult for my
brother)</li>
<li>We could not install ceiling track hoists in a rental property (mobile hoists
are impractical due to the level of my spasticity, needing about five people
to operate - seriously!)</li>
<li>Unless purpose built/adpated, it would not be particularly wheelchair-friendly</li>
<li>Need to find a buyer prepared to leave weeks or months between exchange and
completion</li>
</ul>
<p>There <em>may</em> be a suitable property with hoists already installed, that&rsquo;s
wheelchair accessible?</p>
<h5 id="option-2-bridging-finance">Option 2: bridging finance</h5>
<p><em>Additional cost ~ £293,000. Practicality: uncertain</em></p>
<p>Raising a bridging loan could enable us to buy a new house and spend two or
three months undertaking the adaptations before moving in. This would depend on
finding a lender willing to provide this sort of finance on these terms.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>No need to own (and have the costs of owning) two properties at once</li>
<li>There should be time to adapt the property to my needs before we move</li>
<li>Only need to move once</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bridging finance <em>feels</em> like money for nothing (even if it isn&rsquo;t!)</li>
<li>Need to find a buyer prepared to leave weeks or months between exchange and
completion</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="audacious-option-3-fund-all-costs-outright">Audacious option 3: fund all costs outright</h5>
<p><em>Additional cost ~ £600,0000. Practicality: la la land?</em></p>
<p>Could we raise the full cost of buying a house and adapting it? My dad tells me
that some businesses call this a &ldquo;moon shot&rdquo; <i class="fa fa-moon"></i> or a
&ldquo;big hairy audacious goal&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a lot of money.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>The option involves the least stress and disruption to the family; being able
to move straight into a finished house would be amazing</li>
<li>We could rent out or later on sell our original house, to help with the
ongoing costs of my care</li>
<li>There would be no pressure to complete adaptation works within a fixed time</li>
<li>Only need to move once</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very, very expensive!</li>
<li>My Mum and Dad would spend a lot of time weeping with gratitude</li>
