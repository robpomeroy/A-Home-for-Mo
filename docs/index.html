<h5 id="hello">Hello!</h5>
<p>My identical twin James and I <i class="fa fa-male"></i>
<i class="fa fa-male"></i> were born in 2004, 10 weeks early. We are
survivors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-to-twin_transfusion_syndrome">twin-to-twin transfusion
syndrome</a>.
Because of this condition, I am profoundly disabled
<i class="fa fa-wheelchair-alt"></i> , quadriplegic with severe spastic
cerebral palsy, epilepsy and profound learning difficulties. We live with our Mum
&amp; Dad in Chester in the UK.</p>

<p>Like many people, I have a mixed life. I smile a lot
<i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i> and I love cuddles
<i class="fa fa-heart"></i>. But sometimes life is very difficult.
<i class="fa fa-frown-o"></i> My body is in constant tension because of the
severity of my condition. And I have a lot of seizures. It hurts a lot, but my
Mum and Dad tell me I&rsquo;m very brave.</p>
<p>I love being with my friends and family - especially my brother James. He has
severe learning difficults and is on the autistic spectrum. He makes me laugh.
Like a lot of identical twins, we have a very special bond.</p>

                    <p>I live with my family in a lovely home in Chester, England. As I&rsquo;ve grown older,
and needed more and more help, the house has become too small for me. Soon I
will need two-to-one care, 24 hours a day. We need more space for my supplies,
my equipment and my carers. And we need to keep the family together.</p>
<h4 id="why-a-new-home">Why a new home?</h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s important for me to be near my parents and especially my brother (what can
I say - he needs me!). They know me best and what I need. So I need my family
around me. But I also need my carers.</p>
<p><img src="images/track-hoist.jpg" alt="a ceiling track hoist"></p>
<p>Home is the best place for me where I have everything I need. It&rsquo;s like having a
hospital in my home. And for a hospital, you need a <strong>lot</strong> of space. Space for
my two wheelchairs <i class="fa fa-wheelchair"></i>
<i class="fa fa-wheelchair-alt"></i>, all my supplies, my special bed and
<i class="fa fa-bed"></i> bath <i class="fa fa-bath"></i>, my hoists -
everything.</p>
<p>[ insert more about the bath ]</p>
<p><img src="images/astor-bannerman-bath.jpg" alt="specialist height adjustable bath"></p>
<p>At the same time, it can be difficult for the rest of my family, when there are
carers in the home all day and all night. It makes it hard to have a private
family life. Sometimes I&rsquo;m noisy at night and wake everyone up. My mum is
basically a <i class="fa fa-superpowers"></i> superhero. But even superheroes
need to sleep.</p>

<p>Being disabled is expensive. Being profoundly disabled is <em>really</em> expensive.</p>

<p>We have a big problem <i class="fa fa-bug"></i>. Any house I move to needs to
be adapted for me. That can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Widening doorways for my wheelchair <i class="fa fa-wheelchair-alt"></i></li>
<li>Adding ceiling track hoists</li>
<li>Creating ramped and level access</li>
<li>Installing my specialised bath <i class="fa fa-bath"></i></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/building-work.jpg" alt="building work"></p>
<p>Mum and Dad can&rsquo;t adapt a house while I&rsquo;m living there. They can&rsquo;t afford to
buy another house without selling the existing house. There aren&rsquo;t many places
suitable for me to move to while work is underway and my brother really doesn&rsquo;t
like to be away from me. Staying together is always the best option.</p>
<p>On top of that, moving house once is going to be hard enough (especially since
James struggles with change), but moving twice - once into temporary
accommodation and again into the finished house - is almost unthinkable. The
best option by far is to make the new house ready while we&rsquo;re still living in
the old house. Then we move just once.</p>
<p><img src="images/happy-twins.jpg" alt="building work"></p>
<p>How we do this is our Great Big Problem and it&rsquo;s the reason this website exists.</p>
<h4 id="what-do-i-need">What do I need?</h4>
<p>I need a home:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Chester (it needs to be near
<a href="https://www.deebanksschool.co.uk/">my school</a>
<i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i>; my body makes it difficult to
go long distances - sometimes I need sedation, to be able to travel</li>
<li>With a bedroom and bathroom downstairs for me</li>
<li>With space for my carers</li>
<li>With space for my all supplies and equipment</li>
<li>Ideally, with space for my own washing machine (I won&rsquo;t explain why!)</li>
</ul>
<p>[ insert something about GP, pharmacy and medicines ]</p>
<p>Houses meeting all these requirements tend to be at least £450,000 (for a house
that needs work). In addition, adaptations could cost another £50,000 or more.
This means spending £200,000-300,000 more than my current house is worth. So
we need to raise or borrow at least that much.</p>
<h4 id="how-might-this-be-possible">How might this be possible?</h4>
<p>We&rsquo;re scratching our heads! Here are some options:</p>
<h5 id="option-1-rent-temporary-accommodation">Option 1: rent temporary accommodation</h5>
<p><em>Additional cost ~ £12,000. Practicality: impossible?</em></p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t like this option because of the huge disruption of moving twice. Costs
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying a removal company twice</li>
<li>Rental fees for somewhere suitable in Chester</li>
<li>Storage costs for some of our belongings</li>
</ul>
<p>This probably would not work because we could not install ceiling track hoists
in a rental property. There <em>may</em> be a suitable property with hoists already
installed though.</p>
<p>[ not many places are wheelchair accessible ]</p>
<h5 id="option-2-bridging-finance">Option 2: bridging finance</h5>
<p><em>Additional cost ~ £15,0000. Practicality: uncertain</em></p>
<p>Raising a bridging loan could enable us to buy a new house and spend two or
three months undertaking the adaptations before moving in. This would depend on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding a buyer for our house who was willing to wait this long before moving
in - leaving three months between exchange of contracts and completion.</li>
<li>Finding a lender willing to provide this sort of finance on these terms.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="audacious-option-3-fund-raise---all-of-it">Audacious option 3: fund raise - all of it</h5>
<p><em>Total cost ~ £500,0000. Practicality: la la land?</em></p>
<p>Could we raise the full cost of buying a house and adapting it? My dad tells me
that some businesses call this a &ldquo;moon shot&rdquo; <i class="fa fa-moon"></i> or a
&ldquo;big hairy audacious goal&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a lot of money.</p>
